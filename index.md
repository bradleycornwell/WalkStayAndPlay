Hi Auntie Anne,
My name is Jasper, I'm a handsome beagle hound and I love my holidays with my "Auntie Anne", she is my favourite! I have stayed with "Auntie Anne" since I was a young pup, she always makes me feel so cared for and special. We love to go to the park and sometimes to the pub on a sunny day. I love my time with my main man Harry, he likes to growl when I arrive but this is just a front and he loves to make new friends. WSP is where its at, I'm busy all day with new pals & some best friends who also stay regularly. My mum and dad always worry about me while they are away so "Auntie Anne" sends them updates on their phones. Sometimes she grasses me up and sends videos of me behaving badly too! When the liver cake is on offer we all line up for our photo, liver cake is wonderful!
I love my Auntie Anne and uncle Gary, they are the best and would highly recommend WSP to anyone who wants their hound to have a great holiday.

Anne and Gary are brilliant. They treat all the dogs that come to them like one of their own. They are extremely well cared for and have so much fun.
Before her first session we took Darcie to meet Anne. It was clear from the minute she bounded in the door that she was going to love it. Anne took time to discuss with us what Darcie’s routine was and ensured throughout her stay that that routine was maintained.
Darcie came home exhausted but happy.
I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Walk, Stay and Play to anyone and Darcie can’t wait to go back.

Thank you Anne and Gary.

My two Cavaliers are always very happy staying at Anne's.They get the best attention and walks and love snuggling down on the sofa with Anne and her husband in the evenings!

We have 2 kids .... they are our Fur babies and they are our world
When we need to have time for ourselves for holidays or when we know we can't give them the commitment of being with them for most of the day we give them a holiday with the lovely Anne and Gary at Walk , stay and play. They are looked after in a home environment , taken to have breakfasts at local pubs , cuddles on the sofa , liver cake and generally kissed , cuddled and loved. The kidz love staying with Anne and meantime we can totally relax as we receive constant updates by photos and video so we know they are happy.
It makes such a difference to having time away from our woofas knowing they are happy , loved and playing with Harry the spaniel too ... can't recommend Anne enough .... thank you for making time apart so much easier to cope with you are a true doggie angel xx

Anne came highly recommended to us so we always knew our beloved Airedale Gus would be more than cared for when we went on our holiday to Italy.
He had already been for a play day so we knew as soon as we met Anne that we had nothing to worry about.
We were a little apprehensive when the day came to leave him for 12 days, only because he is our baby and we would have been the same whoever we had left him with, but we couldn’t have been happier with all the care, attention and love that he received from both Anne and her husband Gary.
We had regular updates, videos and photos on WhatsApp, Anne’s dog Harry and the other dogs to play with, walks in the park and visits to the pub, so we couldn’t have felt better about the fun he was having too.
The hard part was prizing Gus away on our return, which speaks volumes for how much fun and how contented he had been.
We can’t thank Anne and Gary enough for looking after our baby boy SO well, so much so that he was a little sad to be home for the first day, as well as the realisation that “homemade treats” were not going to be forthcoming now he was home either.
He is already booked in for next year!
Thank you Anne you are a star.

Alfie my Cocker has three homes. He loves mine, my mums and Walk Stay and Play. It’s like home from home, lots of cuddles, lots of walks and play. When he gets to Anne’s he runs to the front door tail wagging and can’t wait to get inside. It is so lovely to leave him knowing he is happy and safe.

**Racheal & Alfie**

Bailey is a happy dog when he is with Anne. It is his second home, which is the biggest compliment l can pay. You could not have anyone better to look after your Pooch.

**Sue & Bailey**
 
We found Anne in the early days of Walk Stay and Play and having had problems with a previous dog sitter due to Jack's lively character, we were nervous about how he would get on with Anne.
Our worries were completely unfounded as Anne is brilliant with him.
Anne is efficient, reliable, trustworthy and has a great understanding of dogs. When we are away, Jack is collected from ours, taken for a walk then taken to Anne's for his holiday.
He obviously enjoys himself and we come home he is always happy and healthy, so we know he has been well looked after.
We would thoroughly recommend Anne

# Services Provided

## Walking
Due to work or other commitments you may sometimes have to leave your dog longer than you might care to, well, relax knowing that l can take care of that for you.

Your dog will be walked for a full hour, unless otherwise requested. You can choose whether you would prefer walking on their own, on lead, off lead where they can run free and play with other dogs.

I will ensure whatever mud etc they might choose to roll in you will get them back with clean paws, been watered and ready for a sleep.
Your preferences and concerns can all be worked out when we have our initial consultation.

## Day Care and Home Boarding
This service is ideal for days, nights weekends or weeks away as a great alternative to boarding kennels.

Your dog will stay in my home and be treated as my own with lots of love and attention.

Two good walks a day are the minimum and who knows a third maybe on the agenda when my husband gets in from work.

They will have access to a secure garden, treats as agreed and lots of fun! If you require comfort in the knowledge they are having a ball a text service for updates is available free of charge. Day care is also a good way to socialise your dog and get them used to spending time with other 4 pawed friends. It really is a doggie hotel as close to home as you can get.
