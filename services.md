### Services Provided

#### Walking
Due to work or other commitments you may sometimes have to leave your dog longer than you might care to, well, relax knowing that l can take care of that for you.
Your dog will be walked for a full hour, unless otherwise requested. You can choose whether you would prefer walking on their own, on lead, off lead where they can run free and play with other dogs.
I will ensure whatever mud etc they might choose to roll in you will get them back with clean paws, been watered and ready for a sleep.
Your preferences and concerns can all be worked out when we have our initial consultation.

#### Day Care and Home Boarding
This service is ideal for days, nights weekends or weeks away as a great alternative to boarding kennels.
Your dog will stay in my home and be treated as my own with lots of love and attention.
Two good walks a day are the minimum and who knows a third maybe on the agenda when my husband gets in from work.
They will have access to a secure garden, treats as agreed and lots of fun! If you require comfort in the knowledge they are having a ball a text service for updates is available free of charge. Day care is also a good way to socialise your dog and get them used to spending time with other 4 pawed friends. It really is a doggie hotel as close to home as you can get.

Please contact me to arrange a free consultation.
