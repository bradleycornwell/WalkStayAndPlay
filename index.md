Welcome to Walk, Stay and Play!

My name is Anne and I offer a personal and friendly dog walking and sitting service within the Ipswich area, I am fully insured and licensed by Ipswich Borough Council.

I would be love to be able to take care of your dog treating them as I would my own lots of fun, walks and play!

As an experienced dog owner I appreciate that knowing who to trust with your pet is an important decision. I can promise that your dog will be treated as if it were one of my own and that I take the responsibility of minding your dog most seriously.

Before walking your dog I will meet you to get to know your dog and discuss your requirements to give you confidence that your dog is in the best possible hands.

# [Testimonials](#testimonials)

My two Cavaliers are always very happy staying at Anne's.They get the best attention and walks and love snuggling down on the sofa with Anne and her husband in the evenings!

Alfie my Cocker has three homes. He loves mine, my mums and Walk Stay and Play. It’s like home from home, lots of cuddles, lots of walks and play. When he gets to Anne’s he runs to the front door tail wagging and can’t wait to get inside. It is so lovely to leave him knowing he is happy and safe.

**Racheal & Alfie**

Bailey is a happy dog when he is with Anne. It is his second home, which is the biggest compliment l can pay. You could not have anyone better to look after your Pooch.

# [Services](#services)

## Walking
Due to work or other commitments you may sometimes have to leave your dog longer than you might care to, well, relax knowing that l can take care of that for you.

Your dog will be walked for a full hour, unless otherwise requested. You can choose whether you would prefer walking on their own, on lead, off lead where they can run free and play with other dogs.

I will ensure whatever mud etc they might choose to roll in you will get them back with clean paws, been watered and ready for a sleep.
Your preferences and concerns can all be worked out when we have our initial consultation.

## Day Care and Home Boarding
This service is ideal for days, nights weekends or weeks away as a great alternative to boarding kennels.

Your dog will stay in my home and be treated as my own with lots of love and attention.

Two good walks a day are the minimum and who knows a third maybe on the agenda when my husband gets in from work.

They will have access to a secure garden, treats as agreed and lots of fun! If you require comfort in the knowledge they are having a ball a text service for updates is available free of charge. Day care is also a good way to socialise your dog and get them used to spending time with other 4 pawed friends. It really is a doggie hotel as close to home as you can get.
